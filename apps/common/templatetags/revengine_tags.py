    """
    When a user in DjangoAdmin makes a change to a dropdown for `parent_model`, as identified in the DOM by
    the `parent_selector`, a request is made to get the values using `accessor_method` that should then populate the dropdown
    for `child_model`, as identified by `child_selector`.

    `parent_selector` and `child_selector` are used in javascript like so:

    $('select[name="{{parent_selector}}"]')
    $('select[name*="{{child_selector}}"]')

    Note the "name*" wildcard in the child_selector selector. This is necessary due to the way Django names
    selects that contain models added to the admin via Inlines.

    Added to a DjangoAdmin changeform template `admin_change_form_document_ready` block,
    this inclusion tag will add two scripts to the Document. The second script contains
    the javascript necessary to perfrom the actions described above. The first is a JSON
    mapping of the dict returned by this tag.
